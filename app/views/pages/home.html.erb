            <i class="color-black"><strong>“Each one Help One, Each one Teach One” (HOTO)</strong></i> was formed out of the necessity to help those in need with a simplistic and efficient manner. We are a group of seasoned professionals who have experienced varied business environments that were less than optimal and have chosen to be different. Our organization will treat each inquiry with integrity and honesty. All of our team members are here to help, Period; and, as well as having excelled in their own respective fields, each brings with them their own individual perspective and talents. We are now together as one, to make a change in the market place. <strong><i>"Fed Up with the good old boys ways of "pay to play"?</strong> Come home to <strong>HOTO</strong> because we've <strong>been there, done that, and understand.</i></strong><br><br>
            <strong><u>“Collaboration over competition"</u></strong> There is plenty of room on The Village bus to success. We rent the bus together, board the bus together, we sit together, we fix the flat tire together, we arrive at our destination together, then we sit at the same table, where we all talk and make plans to bring two buses on the next trip”. This is who we are.<br><br>
            It is one of our missions to honor our <strong><span class="color-black">Veterans</span></strong> through our works; many of whom are living on the streets and are having issues that no civilian can comprehend. This is an unacceptable tragedy. They need our help and need us to be their advocates. If you love them for their heroic acts in uniform, what they have sacrificed and have done for our country, then you should still love them while they are in their dark place and help bring them out of the darkness. <br>
            We live The Village Creed: “Each One <u>H</u>elp <u>O</u>ne, each one <u>T</u>each <u>O</u>ne”. Please join us in being part of that Village light that helps illuminate the way!
