            <i class="color-black"><strong>“Each one Help One, Each one Teach One” (HOTO)</strong></i> was formed out of the necessity to help those in need with a simplistic and efficient manner. We are an experienced group of individuals who understand, because we have been there. We have experienced varied business environments that were less than optimal and have chosen to be different. Our organization will treat each circumstance with integrity and honesty. Each team member is here to help, Period. Each brings with them their own individual talents, as well as having excelled in their own respective fields. We are now together as one, to make a change in the market place. <strong><i>"Fed Up with the good old boys ways of "pay to play"?</strong> Come home to <strong>HOTO</strong> because we've <strong>been there and lived those situations.</i></strong><br><br>
            “Collaboration over competition" There is plenty of room on The Village bus to success. We rent the bus together, board the bus together, we sit together, we fix the flat tire together, we arrive at our destination together, then we sit at the same table, where we all talk and make plans to bring two buses on the next trip”. That is us.<br><br>
            Many of our <strong><span class="color-black">Veterans</span></strong> are living on the streets. This is an unacceptable tragedy. They need our help and need us to be their advocates. It is one of our missions to honor them through our works. If you love them for their heroic acts in uniform, then you should still love them while they are in their dark place. <br>
            We live The Village Creed. “Each one Help One, Each one Teach One”. Please join us and be that Village light that helps!
